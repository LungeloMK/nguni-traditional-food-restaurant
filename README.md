## Notes
- The screenshot referenced is `images/hero-main.png` — already present in the repository. If you'd prefer a different image, tell me which file to use and I will update `README.md` accordingly.
- If your GitHub account uses 2FA or requires a token, you'll be prompted to authenticate when pushing. If you'd like me to attempt the push for you, provide the remote URL and confirm you want me to run the push command here.
